Ingredients

For the chicken:
24 oz 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 celery stalk (diced)
1/2 onion (diced)
1 clove garlic (minced)
16 oz fat free low sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup cayenne pepper sauce (I used Frank's)

For the wraps:
6 large lettuce leaves (Bibb or Iceberg)
1 1/2 cups shredded carrots
2 large celery stalks (cut into 2 inch matchsticks)

Instructions


In a slow cooker, combine chicken, onions, celery stalk, garlic and broth (enough to cover your chicken, use water if the can of broth isn't enough).
Cover and cook on high 4 hours.

Remove the chicken from pot, reserve 1/2 cup broth and discard the rest.
Shred the chicken with two forks, return to the slow cooker with the 1/4 to 1/2 cup broth and the hot sauce and set to on high for an additional 30 minutes. Makes 3 cups chicken.

To prepare lettuce cups, place 1/2 cup buffalo chicken in each leaf, top with 1/4 cup shredded carrots, celery and dressing of your choice. Wrap up and start eating!
