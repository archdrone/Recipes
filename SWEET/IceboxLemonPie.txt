INGREDIENTS
2 cup graham cracker crumbs (about 14 graham crackers)
1/4 cup sugar
6 tbsp butter, melted

1 cup fresh lime juice 
1/3 cups fresh lemon juice
2 14 oz cans sweetened condensed milk
8 large egg yolks
4 tbsp finely lime lemon zest


INSTRUCTIONS

PIE CRUST:

1. Grease pie pan.
2. Mix together graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter.
3. Press graham cracker mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch pie pan to make the crust.
4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
5. Bake the crust until set and golden, 8 minutes. Set aside on a wire rack; leave the oven on.


FILLING:

5. Beat the egg yolks and lime zest at high speed until very fluffy.
6. Gradually add the condensed milk and continue to beat until thick
7. Lower the mixer speed and slowly add the lime juice, mixing just until combined, no longer.
8. Pour filling into the pie crust.


BAKE:

9. Pour the mixture into the crust. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the filling has just set. Cool on a wire rack, then refrigerate. 

For Joshua: Freeze for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.


Notes
1) I did mini pies and they turned out great
2) Pre-cooking the crust is a good idea but be careful not to overcook. A little raw is better
3) If the filling is too lose, it won't setup. So be careful with the lime/lemon juice. Maybe add another egg yolk if too much
It must be why the original have you add it slowly.
