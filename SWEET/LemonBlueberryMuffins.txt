These Healthy Lemon Blueberry Muffins are THE most moist, cake like muffin on our entire site. Made with fresh blueberries, lemon, creamy yogurt they are also packed with nutrition and less sugar than most other muffins out there!

Ingredients
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon oil
1/4 cup Greek yogurt, plain
2/3 cup buttermilk
1 tbsp lemon juice fresh squeezed
1 tbsp lemon zest
1 large egg
1 cup blueberries

Instructions
Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Spray muffin cups lightly with cooking spray or use muffin liners.
Combine the flours, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, yogurt, buttermilk, lemon juice, lemon zest and egg until incorporated. 
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix just until combined. Gently fold in the blueberries.
Divide batter evenly among the muffin cups (using an ice cream scoop works great here if you have one!).
Bake for 18 minutes or until golden on top and the muffins bounce back when touched.
Cool on a wire rack before serving.
