Sequilhos (Cornstarch Cookies)
From: https://www.oliviascuisine.com/wprm_print/recipe/27099/



INGREDIENTS  
113 grams unsalted butter (8 tablespoons), softened to room temperature
200 grams sweetened condensed milk (1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons)
1/4 teaspoon Kosher salt
280 grams cornstarch (2 1/4 cups)

EQUIPMENT
Baking Sheets
Mixing Bowl
Spatula

INSTRUCTIONS 
Combine the butter, sweetened condensed milk and salt in a large bowl. Using a spatula, mix everything until the butter is incorporated into the condensed milk. A few remaining lumps is okay!

Slowly add the cornstarch, mixing with the spatula to combine. It will eventually get hard to use the spatula, and you can then use your hands. Mix just until a smooth dough forms. You might not need all the cornstarch and should avoid the temptation to add everything if it's not needed.

Roll the cookie dough (about 1 teaspoon per cookie) into balls and press each ball with your thumb (like you would thumbprint cookies). Place the balls on a two baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Using a fork, slightly flatten the cookies, also making their characteristic fork indentations.

Refrigerate the cookies for 30 minutes to avoid them spreading when baking.

Preheat oven to 350ÂºF with a rack in the middle.

Bake the cookies for 15 minutes or until they begin to gain some color on the bottom. They should still be quite pale on the top.
Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool slightly still on the baking sheets. After 15-20 minutes, carefully remove them to a wiring rack so they can finish cooling.

NOTES
Customizations
Want to add some fun flavorings to your sequilhos? These are some of my favorites:
1/2 teaspoon lime, lemon or orange zest
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
2 tablespoons shredded coconut
1 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract (you might need to add more cornstarch to reach the dough consistency)
Storage
Sequilhos will keep for up to a week, stored in an airtight container.
