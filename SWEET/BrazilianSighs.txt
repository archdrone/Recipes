Brazilian Sighs
https://www.ateaspoon.com/recipes/2020/2/29/suspiros-8a6t8

4 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup powdered sugar
pinch of salt
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

  Recipe fo powder sugar:
   The magic ratio is 1 cup granulated sugar to 1 tablespoon cornstarch. Combine the two in a high-powered blender like a Vitamix, a food processor, or spice grinder, then blitz away until you have a soft, powdery consistencyâ€”the total time could be several minutes, depending on the power of your machine.


Recipe

1) Place the egg whites and the cream of tartar in the bowl of a standing mixer.

2) Beat the egg whites on medium speed until the egg whites form soft peaks.

3) Gradually add the granulated sugar, while still beating the egg whites. Continue to beat the egg whites until they have increased in volume and are forming stiff peaks. Sift the powdered sugar together with the salt, then add gradually to the egg whites, continuing to beat, until well mixed.

4) Gently drip the vanilla extract into the meringue.

5) Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.

6) Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or cover cookie sheet with butter. 

7) Pipe the meringue into small swirls onto the parchment-lined cookie sheets, spacing them about 1/2 inch apart. You can also use teaspoons to drop them on cookie sheet in the form of a kiss.

8) Place the cookies in the oven and bake for about 1 hour, checking them every 15 minutes. Once they look crisp and well formed, turn off the heat and let them cool off in the oven for about 2 hours.

9) Serve the suspiros immediately or store them in an airtight container to ensure freshness.
