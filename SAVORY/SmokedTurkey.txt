Ingredients
1 recipe turkey brine optional, if you choose to brine your turkey, you can skip the chicken broth basting
12 lb whole turkey giblets and neck removed
1/2 cup BBQ rub
1 onion quartered
1 lemon quartered
4 sprigs fresh herbs such as thyme, rosemary or parsley
3 cups chicken broth
fresh herbs for garnish
cooking spray

Instructions

Preheat the smoker to 250 degrees F. Load the smoker with apple wood.
Coat a large disposable aluminum pan with cooking spray. Place the turkey in the pan and tuck the wings under the body.
Stuff the cavity of the turkey with the onion, lemon and herbs, then use kitchen twine to tie the legs together.
Sprinkle the BBQ rub all over the surface of the turkey.
Place the turkey in the smoker. Cook for 6-7 hours, basting with chicken broth every 30-45 minutes, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F.  Refill the wood chips as needed.
If the turkey starts to get too dark, cover it with foil.
Let the turkey rest for 10-15 minutes then transfer to a serving plate. Garnish with herbs if desired, then serve.
