Taken from: https://cafedelites.com/wprm_print/67781


Ingredients
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 pound (250 g) ground beef mince
1/2 pound (250 g) ground pork mince, (or beef)
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper
1 large egg
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, or parmesan cheese
1/2 cup breadcrumbs
2 tablespoons fresh basil (or parsley), finely chopped
1/2 cup milk, (or water)


Heat oil in a medium-sized pan over medium heat. Sauté onion until soft, (about 2 minutes). Add garlic and sauté for a further minute, until fragrant. Set aside.

Preheat oven to 410°F (210°C). Line a large baking pan with parchment paper. Set aside.

In a large bowl combine half of the sautéed onion and garlic mixture with the ground meats, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, egg, cheese, breadcrumbs and basil (or parsley). Add half of the milk, mixing a little with your hands, then add the rest of the milk. Mix again until all ingredients are just combined (don't over mix or meatballs will be hard/tough).*

Scoop out 1-tablespoonful of meat per meatball and roll into balls, placing meatballs on lined baking pan as you go.

Spray generously with cooking oil spray and bake for 12 minutes, or until just cooked though.

Broil (grill) on high heat in the last 2 minutes of cooking time to get them crispy and browned.

Warm Pasta Sauce

Transfer baked meatballs and pan juices into the sauce. Stir to evenly coat and let simmer for about 2-3 minutes to let the sauce infuse into the meat and completely cook the meatballs.
