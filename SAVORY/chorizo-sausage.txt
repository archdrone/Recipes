INGREDIENTS

2 lbs ground pork (going to try ground chicken or tofu)

3 large dried New Mexico chiles (Chile
Colorin) or 3 large mild red chilies
(about 3.5-inches)

4 small dried chile de arbol (Chile
deArbol) or 4 small chilies, according
to how hot spicy you want your
chorizo

1⁄4 cup boiling water
8 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons dry oregano leaves
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dark brown sugar
4 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 tablespoons tequila
3 1⁄2 teaspoons salt



DIRECTIONS
1. Break the colorin chiles into 3 pieces,
and put them and the deArbol peppers
in a bowl.
2. Pour the boiling water over them and let
them sit until they're re-hydrated and
soft.
3. Place the re-hydrated chiles together
with the liquid into a food processor
and add the garlic, oregano, cumin,
black pepper, sugar, vinegar, tequila,
and salt, and process until the mixture is
smooth.
4. Place ground pork and the liquid
mixture into a sturdy electric mixer
(such as a KitchenAid) and mix well.
5. When secured in a sealed container, this
chorizo keeps well in the refrigerator for
a couple of weeks. I usually let it sit in
the fridge for a couple of days to let the
flavors meld, then divide it into smaller
portions of 3 to 4 ounces (that's about
two servings) and freeze it. If you have
casings, you can also stuff it into those
and smoke it - very tasty
