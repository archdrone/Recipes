https://www.food.com/recipe/brined-pork-roast-62404

2 quarts water or 2 quarts apple juice
⁄ cup kosher salt (coarse grain)
⁄
cup granulated sugar or 1/4 cup brown
sugar
1 teaspoon thyme
3 bay leaves
5 whole cloves
10 juniper berries, crushed (optional)
1 teaspoon anise seed
1 teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed
1 pork roast, any size



 Combine all ingredients in a saucepan.
 Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer
gently for 15 minutes.

 Cool to room temperature.

 Immerse pork roast of your choice in
the cooled brine mixture, and refrigerate
for 12 hours or overnight (up to 24
hours) turning occasionally if necessary
for even brining.

 Remove roast from brine, rinse, and pat
dry with paper towels, and roast (on a
rack or grill pan) according to your
favorite recipe until a thermometer,
inserted in the center of the roast, reads
155 degrees.

 Allow the roast to rest for 20 minutes
before carving.
