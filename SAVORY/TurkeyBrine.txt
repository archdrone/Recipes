Ingredients
2 cups apple cider
2 gallons cold water
1 1/2 cups kosher salt
1 cup brown sugar
5 cloves garlic smashed
2 tablespoons peppercorns
2 oranges thinly sliced
2 lemons thinly sliced
5 rosemary sprigs
3 bay leaves

Instructions
Place all the ingredients in a large pot over medium heat. Bring to a simmer.
Cook for 2-3 minutes or until salt and sugar have dissolved. 
Turn off the heat. Let the brine mixture cool.
Place a whole turkey in the brine solution to fully submerge it, then refrigerate for 18-24 hours. 
When you're ready to cook your turkey, remove it from the brine and rinse with cool water; pat dry with paper towels.
