From: https://www.dontgobaconmyheart.co.uk/wprm_print/6986

Ingredients
3.3lb / 1.5kg Whole Chicken, divided (or individual bone in skin on pieces - see notes)
4 cups / 1litre Vegetable Oil, or as needed for deep frying (see notes)
Wet Mix
2 cups / 500ml Buttermilk
1 tsp EACH: Paprika, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Salt

Dry Mix
2.5 cups / 375g Plain/All Purpose Flour
1 tbsp Paprika
2 tsp EACH: Oregano, Baking Powder
1.5 tsp Salt, plus extra to sprinkle at the end
1 tsp EACH: Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Cayenne Pepper, Black Pepper

Instructions
In a bowl, combine the wet mix with your chicken, ensuring it's fully coated by the marinade.
Cover and allow to marinate in the fridge for an absolute minimum of 4 hours, but the longer the better (up to 24hours).
Remove at least 30mins before you intend to use it to bring to room temp (important - frying cold chicken causes it to seize up and go chewy).


combine all of your dry mix. 
Dip a piece of your chicken into the mix and fully coat. 

Heat up enough oil to comfortably cover the depth of your largest piece of chicken.
 Drop a piece of mixture in, if it slowly sizzles to the top you're good to go.
 You want the oil to be approx 175C/350F - 180C/356F.
