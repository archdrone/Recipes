Dad's Tacos Recipe 

Ingredients 

For sautee 
One medium yellow onion diced 
4-5 (or as many as you want) jalapeños diced 
6 (or as many as you want) garlic cloves pressed or diced very fine 

Meat 
1 lb lean ground beef 
1 lb ground turkey 
1 lb plant-based ground beef substitute if available 
(alternative: 1 lb. ground sirloin or Angus + 1 lb. very lean beef + 1 lb. ground turkey) 1 carrot shredded in food processor 
1 zucchini shredded in food processor 

Spice mix 
⅓ cup flour 
1 tablespoon (tbsp) (or more if you prefer) chile powder 
1 tbsp ground cinnamon 
1 tbsp ground paprika (preferably Hungarian &/or Smoked Spanish) 1 tbsp ground Cayenne pepper 
1 tbsp ground oregano 
1 tbsp ground nutmeg 
Cooking liquid 
1 14 oz. can tomatoes (preferably diced with green chile) pureed in food processor 1 bottle dark beer 
Optional addition (if available): 3-4 dried Ancho &/or other dried chile(s) with seeds &  membrane removed + 2nd bottle dark beer; place in sauce pan with beer; bring to boil,  simmer on low for 30 min., then puree with the diced tomatoes 

Cooking 
Sautee the onion & jalapeños on medium heat until the onion is limp, about 10 minutes,  stirring often 
Add the garlic & stir briefly 
Add the meat, including the shredded carrot & zucchini, & stir until the beef & turkey  are brown 
Remove from heat & drain the liquid grease 
Return to heat and add the spice mix & cooking liquid 
Bring to boil then cook on medium heat, stirring often (try to keep flour from sticking to  the bottom of the pan), until most of the liquid is evaporated (leave a little liquid so when  you rewarm it won’t be dried out) 
Remove from heat and serve with shells or tortillas and the usual additions (lettuce, diced  tomatoes, shredded cheese, salsa, etc.)
