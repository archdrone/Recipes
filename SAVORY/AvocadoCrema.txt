Avocado Crema in a glass jar with a wood spoon and cut avocado on a tray
INGREDIENTS
1 large avocado approximately 6 ounces of avocado meat after removing skin and pit
1/4 cup canned full fat coconut milk
2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 Tablespoon lime juice
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
INSTRUCTIONS
Place all ingredients in bowl of food processor of jar of blender (FYI: you will usually get a thicker sauce in the food processor), process until smooth and creamy.

Use immediately. I recommend pouring into a squeeze bottle and serving from there. Enjoy!

NOTES:
STORAGE TIPS:

You can store any leftovers in an air-tight container but know that the color may darken slightly over time as the avocado oxidizes. 

A very small amount of avocado oil or olive oil poured over the top of the crema can help preserve it for an extra day in the fridge.
