Original derived from: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/244188/copycat-chipotle-chicken/

Ingredient Checklist
1 can chipotle in adobo
1/2 cup water
1/2 red onion, cut into small chunks
4 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons sea salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
2â€‰1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs

Directions:

Step 1
Blend chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a blender until a coarse paste forms; add olive oil and blend until marinade is smooth.

Step 2
Pound chicken thighs flat with a meat mallet and trim excess skin. Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade. Turn chicken several times to coat. Seal bag and marinate at least 8 hours.

Step 3
Preheat an outdoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat. Remove chicken from bag and discard marinade.

Step 4
Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut into strips.
