https://www.southyourmouth.com/2015/11/southern-cornbread-dressing-with-sausage.html

INGREDIENTS:
1 family-size pan of cornbread (see notes)
1 pound sausage
1 large onion, diced
3-4 celery stalks, diced (about 2 cups)
1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
2 cups chicken or turkey broth
1 can cream of chicken soup
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning (or more to taste)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Crumble corn bread into small pieces then add to a large mixing bowl; set aside.
Cook and crumble sausage until cooked through and nicely browned. Drain fat then add sausage to the bowl of cornbread (do not stir yet).
Sauté onion and celery in butter for 4-5 minutes or until onion is semi-translucent. Add veggies and butter to the bowl of cornbread (do not stir yet).
Combine chicken broth, cream of chicken soup, salt and poultry seasoning in a mixing bowl then whisk together until smooth. Pour broth mixture into bowl with cornbread mixture and gently stir and fold until well combined.
Spray a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray (or grease with butter) then spoon cornbread mixture into dish.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 25-35 minutes or until lightly browned and heated through.


NOTES:
By ‘family-size’ I mean a 13x9 pan or large skillet of cornbread. You can also use 2 6-serving boxes cornbread mix, prepared

Do not use a sweet cornbread recipe when making dressing

Feel free to leave the sausage out if you’d prefer

If you like bell pepper in your dressing, add about a cup when sautéing the onion and celery

Do not prepare the cream of chicken soup before adding

If you prefer your dressing to be more dense and loaf-like, stir the ingredients really well before spooning into the baking dish

My family also really likes to add chopped boiled eggs too! I think that's a regional thing
