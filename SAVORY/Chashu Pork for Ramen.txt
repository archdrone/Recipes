Chashu Pork for Ramen
https://www.marionskitchen.com/how-to-chashu-pork-for-ramen/

1.2kg (2.6 lb) pork belly
1 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup mirin*
1/3 cup sake
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 cup water
4cm (1.5 inch) piece of ginger, sliced
2 garlic cloves, lightly crushed

Steps:

Roll the pork belly up tightly to form a cylinder shape. Tie string around the pork belly at regular intervals so that it
keeps its shape while cooking (see the recipe video for Marion’s technique for this).

In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sugar, mirin, sake and 1 cup of water.
Preheat the oven to 120°C/250°F.

Heat the vegetable oil in a deep , oven-proof pan or Dutch oven over high heat. Add the pork belly and sear on all
sides for about 2 minutes per side or until evenly golden in colour. Pour over the soy sauce mixture. Add the ginger
and garlic. Then top up with extra water until at least half the pork belly is submerged. Cover with a lid and cook in
the oven for 3 hours, turning the pork every half an hour. Alternatively, cover and reduce the heat to low on the
stovetop and simmer for 3 hours, turning every half an hour.

Let the pork and braising liquid cool to warm. Then transfer both to a large bowl, cover and refrigerate overnight.

The next day, remove the fat from the top of the braising liquid. Transfer the pork to a cutting board. Remove the
string and slice into thin pieces. Before serving (either with ramen or with rice) heat the pork slices in a non-stick
frying pan until golden.


Notes:
– Mirin is a type of Japanese cooking rice wine (it has less alcohol than sake but is sweeter). It’s available in the
Asian aisle of some major supermarkets or from an Asian grocery store.

Tips & Tricks:
– Reserve the braising liquid and use it as a master stock or use it to add extra avour to soup broths.
