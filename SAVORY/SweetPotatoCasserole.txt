Sweet Potato Casserole

Ingredients
3 pounds sweet potatoes peeled and roughly cubed
1 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons butter melted
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup milk as up to 1 cup for desired consistency
2 cups mini marshmallows
Toasted Pecans for garnish optional

Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. 

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and boil sweet potatoes until fork tender; about 20 minutes. Drain.

Mash the sweet potatoes with a potato masher until smooth. (Use a hand mixer if you want absolutely smooth with no lumps).

Stir in brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and salt until well combined. Add the milk a small amount at a time to reach desired consistency.

Spray an 11-inch x 7-inch (medium sized) casserole baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Spread sweet potatoes evenly in the prepared casserole dish and top with a layer of the marshmallows.

Bake for 20-25 minutes or until marshmallows are golden brown.

Allow to cool for 5-10 minutes before serving. Garnish with toasted pecans.

Notes
If you find the marshmallows are starting to burn, remove the casserole from the oven sooner. You just need the casserole to be hot throughout, so there's no worry about under-cooking anything.
To make this ahead of time: Refrigerate the potato mixture in the casserole dish overnight and leave off the marshmallows until you're ready to bake. Add 5-10 minutes to the baking times and add the marshmallows halfway through the baking to avoid burning.
Freezing after baking is not recommended. However, you can freeze the prepped sweet potato without the topping. Spread the mashed sweet potato in a casserole dish, or even in a freezer bag, and squeeze out as much air as possible. Lay flat and freeze for up to 3 months.
