INGREDIENTS:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 onion, diced
2 carrots, peeled and diced
2 celery ribs, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 cups chicken stock
2 bay leaves
Kosher salt freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skinless chicken breasts
2 1/2 cups wide egg noodles
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more, to taste

DIRECTIONS:
Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Whisk in chicken stock and bay leaves; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add chicken and bring to boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until the chicken is cooked through, about 30-40 minutes. Remove chicken and let cool before dicing into bite-size pieces, discarding bones.

Stir in chicken and pasta and cook until tender, about 6-7 minutes.

Remove from heat; stir in parsley, dill and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Serve immediately.

Notes:
Too much noodles. And I bet it would be better with marinated chicken
