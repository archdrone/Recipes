Dad's Smoked Tokrey

Injection Liquid

⅓ cup cooking oil

⅓ cup jalapeño pickling juice (from jar of pickled jalapeños; the jalapeños can be used to stuff in the cavity)

1 tsp ground dried mustard

(optional) ½ cup chicken stock/broth

¼ cup brandy

¼ cup orange juice

 

Rub (optional, if not using the paste)

2 tbsps coarse salt

2 tbsps brown sugar

2 tbsps cinnamon

½ tsp ground dried mustard

½ tsp or more cayenne pepper

½ tsp or more chile powder

 

Paste

8 oz. cranberry sauce

8 oz. jalapeño jelly

garlic cloves (as many as you like)

2 tbsp butter (room temperature)

½ small onion cut into chunks

1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

1 tbsp onion powder

1 tbsp ground black pepper

1 tbsp coarse salt

2 tbsp orange juice

2 tbsp brandy

 

The night before cooking

In a food processor blend the paste ingredients

Remove the gizzards, liver, & neck from inside the cavity.

With a cooking syringe inject the turkey breast and legs with the injection liquid. Be careful to avoid sticking the point all the way into the cavity.

Smear the paste all over and, where you can, under the skin (be careful not to tear the skin) and inside the cavity.

Stuff the cavity with pickled jalapeños and (optional) sliced apples and oranges (or vegetables like carrots, etc. if you prefer)

Put in a turkey-size oven bag and refrigerate overnight



Smoking the turkey

Take the turkey out of the bag and wrap it in wet cheesecloth

Place the turkey in a large aluminum pan on the grill, along with the giblets

Load the smoke box with apple or pecan wood (or another fruit tree wood)

Cook at 225-250°

Baste with the juices in the pan every 30 minutes

After an hour or two the giblets should be done

Remove the cheese cloth after 3 hours

Cook the turkey until the internal temperature reaches 165°

(The injection liquid causes it to cook faster than an hour per pound. The breast reaches the right internal temperature before the drumsticks, so you may have to microwave the dark meat for a minute or two after it’s carved, before serving)

 

After smoking

Let the turkey sit inside with a foil tent over it for at least 30 minutes
