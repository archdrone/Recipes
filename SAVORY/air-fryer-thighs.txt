Ingredients
1 Tbsp cornstarch 
1 tsp smoked paprika 
1/2 tsp garlic powder 
1/4 tsp onion powder 
1/4 tsp dried oregano 
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper 
1/2 tsp salt 
1/4 tsp Freshly cracked pepper
4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2.25 lbs.) 
1 Tbsp cooking oil

Instructions
In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, cayenne, salt, and pepper.
Preheat the air fryer to 400ºF. Pat the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel.
Place the chicken thighs in a bowl and drizzle the cooking oil over top, then add the cornstarch and seasoning mixture. Toss the chicken thighs until they are well coated in oil and spices.
Place the chicken thighs in the air fryer basket, skin side up, and cook for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken thighs and cook for 8 minutes more.
Flip one last time so the skin side is up and cook for two minutes. Use a meat thermometer to make sure the internal temperature has reached 165ºF, and if not, cook for 1-2 minutes longer. Serve the chicken thighs hot with your favorite simple sides!
