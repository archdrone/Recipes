This Mexican-inspired meatloaf with taco seasoning is a delicious comfort food dish. My Mexican grandmother would use leftover corn tortilla chips in our meatloaf, and everyone loved it! They all wanted seconds along with the recipe.

Yield: 1 9x5x3-inch loaf
Ingredients

1 ½ pounds lean ground beef

1 small onion, chopped

1 cup crushed tortilla chips

¾ cup shredded pepper Jack cheese

1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix

2 large eggs, beaten

½ cup milk

¼ cup mild red taco sauce, or more to taste

Directions
Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Mix together beef, onion, tortilla chips, pepper Jack cheese, and taco seasoning in a large bowl until combined.

Whisk together eggs, milk, and taco sauce in a medium bowl.

Add to beef mixture and stir until well combined.

Press mixture into a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Pour a strip of taco sauce down the center of loaf.

Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and browned on top, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).

Serve and enjoy!
