My game \"Hexical\" was in the February NextFest. And either the game was just good not great or I suck at game marketing. But it didn't get quite the showing I was hoping for. However! I had implemented an achievement (mostly just to figure out how) and achievement hunters found the game! It was no Balatro but my game was played all over the world and even found a bug by some of the feedback.  So just a tip! Cheers!",

Promote and market your game PRIOR to the start of the Next Fest. Wishlist momentum is a thing, getting coverage the week before helps\n\n2. Search YouTube for Steam Next Fest and reach out to creators that cover game demos in your genre\n\n3. Keep your demo up after the festival! It’s only 7 short days and creators need the time to (hopefully) get to your game\n\n4. If you have a previous version of the demo, release an updated version of the demo during the festival with new stuff.\n\n5. Update and optimize your Steam page so that you get higher wishlist conversion when people end up on your Steam Page.\n\n6. Make sure your press kit assets are updates. Main character/bosses PNGs are much appreciated so that Content Creators and use them for thumbnails.\n\n7. It is unfortunately a popularity contest, where games that currently have the most wishlists gets surfaced first, leading to even more wishlists during the festival\n\n8. Do WHATEVER you can to get onto “Popular Upcoming” - This is refreshed daily so stick with it. The number of wishlists that you get when you actually get on the list is massive\n\n9. “Live Stream feature” - Developers that go live do get surfaced more. I would recommend a pre-recorded video of you playing and talking about the game (about 30min-1hr), and then create a 24hr video of various creators playing and talking about the game (ask for permission first)\n\n10. Demo construction -  Much like full games, people don’t often make it much further than the first part of the game/demo, so focus on the opening. DO NOT have a slow prologue style opening to the game. Having it playable up to the first chapter/boss is a decent amount of content, players need to be able to get a feel for the game.\n    \nRogue-lites generally have it easier due to the procedural generation since even the demo offers replayability.\n    \nIf you have a more linear title, it might be worth the effort to make a custom demo that is not just the first area/level of your game.\n\nFor more tips like this, sign up here: https://t.co/65ZpdsBgez\n\nThe first guide for emailing content creators is just about ready to be published!",
