1/4
  - Feeling better. I think I need to prioritize work less and life more. I'm not suddenly going to be a slacker. But there needs to be healthier boundaries.
    Work shouldn't be an excuse not to live. In fact, the other way around. So I think this year, its more about helping people to help themselves and ensuring that
    I have more time for myself and my family. I got Lead. It would have nice been to principal but it doesn't matter. And I'm making progress on shipping the game.
    First class for fencing is on the 9th!
